# Creating articles with HTML

**version 1.0.0**

These are simple web articles created with HTML.

This is a learing project of Radium Rocket - Become a QA automation - to copy and write a web article with HTML and CSS.
The index.html file is based on the following article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/12/space-force-virtual-reality-training/ and the file named week7.html is based on the following article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/17/nft-beeple-metakovan-christies/.
Both files should be an identical copy of the 'real' articles without the advertisements.
